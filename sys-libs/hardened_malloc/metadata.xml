	<longdescription>
		This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the
		malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening
		against heap corruption vulnerabilities. The security-focused design also
		leads to much less metadata overhead and memory waste from fragmentation
		than a more traditional allocator design. It aims to provide decent overall
		performance with a focus on long-term performance and memory usage rather
		than allocator micro-benchmarks. It offers scalability via a configurable
		number of entirely independently arenas, with the internal locking within
		arenas further divided up per size class.
